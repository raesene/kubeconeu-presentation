Note: 

So the attack surface for a system is very important as it represents the ways in which an attacker can try to gain access to it.  The more attack surface, the more opportunities for the attacker to find a mis-configuration or vulnerability.

# Cloudy Clusters

Note:

Cloud based deployments are increasingly common.  They change things from an attack surface perspective as a) the cloud service management methods (e.g. AWS portal, awscli) are part of your attack surface.  Also the consequences of compromise can be worse (it's not just your cluster that gets compromised, it's the whole cloud setup)
